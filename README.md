# Player Stats Leaderboard 🏆

A React Native + Expo project built for **Sportsdunia**, showcasing a dynamic leaderboard that calculates "Most Valuable Player" (MVP) scores from raw match event data.

## 🚀 About
Sportsdunia began in 2023 with a mission to deliver sports coverage that truly speaks to fans — going beyond scores with in-depth analysis, predictions, and real-time updates across football, cricket, NBA, WNBA, and esports.

This project demonstrates how to process raw player event logs into meaningful insights, displaying a sorted leaderboard of top performers.

## 🎯 Objective
- Fetch raw mock data (`players.json` and `events.json`)
- Compute MVP scores based on defined rules
- Display a leaderboard sorted from highest to lowest score
- Add a toggle button to filter **Top Performers** (score ≥ 20)

## 📂 Data Sources
- **players.json**
  ```json
  [{ "id": 101, "name": "Virat K." }, { "id": 102, "name": "Pat C." }, ...]
